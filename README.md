# front-end-practice6
11/3/2023 i used alot of chatgpt for the javascript, my head is getting overwhelmed, there's still 1 thing i cant fix in this code, its that when you for example clicked 'frontend' and click the x button, it will not revert and show all the things again since you press the x in the front end, I hope the future me can fix this. That's all!
